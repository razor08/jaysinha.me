About Me
========
Hi, I am Jay. 

Research Interests
=========
I am interested in working on core deep learning methodologies to enhance the traditional methods of model training and usage in real-world applications. There is already a significant body of work in this domain, but I hope to expand on it by researching possible optimizations and exploring more effective approaches that will enable the same results with reduced training times and/or from a smaller representative dataset than a usual massive dataset. (Optimization in Machine Learning)

On the other hand, I hope to work on robust applied deep learning models and towards more informative backtracking of feature sets. This would bolster learning by reducing the redundancies involved and will make the models less susceptible to noisy data.

Additionally, I hope to work on cross-disciplinary applications with the help of complex neural network architectures and explore the applications of multimodal learning with audio and visual contexts.

My long-term research goal is to model information processing underlying day-to-day interactions.

Interested in Collaboration?
===========
If you are interested in collaborating with me, please feel free to drop me an email.
