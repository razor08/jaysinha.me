<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jaysinha.me/train-your-first-neural-network-for-image-similarity-search/">Train your first neural network for Image Similarity Search</a></h3>
<p>In this tutorial, we use metric learning in order to search the nearest neighbours or similar images to a given image from the CIFAR-10 dataset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jaysinha.me/train-your-first-autoencoder-for-reconstructing-a-noisy-image/">Train your first Autoencoder for reconstructing a noisy image</a></h3>
<p>In this tutorial, we will train an Autoencoder to denoise MNIST images to reproduce clean pictures of digits from the MNIST dataset.</p>
</li>

<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jaysinha.me/train-your-first-cyclegan-for-image-to-image-translation/">Train your first CycleGAN for Image to Image Translation</a></h3>
<p>In this tutorial, we will train a CycleGAN model to translate photos of horses to zebras, and back again to horses. The model we are going to train is the very model which was trained in the CycleGAN paper. CycleGANs are great for unsupervised training capabilities.</p>

<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jaysinha.me/build-your-first-neural-network-for-image-restoration/">Build your first Neural Network for Image Restoration</a></h3>
<p>Sneak peak into the methodology on which <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/geforce/technologies/dlss/">Nvidia's DLSS</a> works! In this tutorial, we build an SR-CNN model that learns end-to-end mapping of low resolution to high-resolution images. As a result, we can use it to improve the image quality of low-resolution images.</p>
